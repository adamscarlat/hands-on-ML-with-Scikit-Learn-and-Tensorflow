Custom Models and Training with Tensorflow
------------------------------------------
* Keras can help with most cases where we need to build a neural network.

* There are situations in which we'll need to go deeper and work with the underlying tensorflow API.
  For example:
  - Writing custom loss functions
  - Custom metrics
  - Custom layers
  - Custom weight constraints
  - And more...

* TensorFlow's ecosystem
  - Low level python API and Computation graph
  - IO processing libraries (e.g. tf.data, tf.image, etc.)
  - Visualization (tensorboard)
  - Deployment (TFX)
  - Pre-trained model garden 
  - And more...
